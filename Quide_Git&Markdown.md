# Hello Dear
### Here you will find som—É notes about how to work with:
* Git ~~(maybe GitHub later)~~
* Markdown

## Git
1. First of all you need to add folder to traceable by command **_git init_**
2. Lets add current file to Git by **_Ctrl+S_** (or autosave) and by **_git add ..._** command ( where ... name of your file). It is useful to use **_TAB_** button to rapid fill name of the file needed
3. After you should use command **_git commit -m"your comment"_** to be able to set comment to your point - to your **commit**
4. To check if you initiate tracing launch command  **_git status_** to see files/folder under monitoring
5. To see your versions (commits) launch command  **_git log_**
